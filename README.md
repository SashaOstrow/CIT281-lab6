# Lab 6
Lab goals and outcomes:

Practice using JavaScript classes by creating a digital book library system. You will define and work with two main classes: `Book` and `Library`.

    Part 1: Join GitHub and work through Introduction to GitHub course
    Part 2: Create lab file
    Part 3: Classes overview
    Part 4: Create and test Book class
    Part 5: Create and test Library class
    Part 6: Add at least two more books to the library
    Part 7: Add ISBN and a delete book method
    
This lab strengthens your understanding of object-oriented programming. The lab helps with learning how to build a small object-oriented system using JavaScript classes to model a **digital book library**, working with **constructors**, **methods**, **arrays of objects**, and **class interactions**. This lab also introduced **GitHub usage** and **repo organization**.
